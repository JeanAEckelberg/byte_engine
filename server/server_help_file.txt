database.py
-----------

The database file is what's used to create the actual database in the project. The file listed here creates it with
SQLite.


main.py
-------

The main file is what uses FastAPI to create the URLs that utilize the schemas. If the root page is accessed, it will
print 'Hello World.' If so, congrats! Your server is up and running.

Typing in the other URLs listed in each method should return the data needed, assuming it's in the database. HTTP errors
are raised if something goes wrong, and these are caught and handled in the client_utils.py file.
