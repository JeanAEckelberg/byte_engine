    `Occupiable Class Notes:`

        Occupiable objects exist to encapsulate all objects that could be placed on the gameboard.

        These objects can only be occupied by GameObjects, so inheritance is important. The ``None`` value is
        acceptable for this too, showing that nothing is occupying the object.

        Note: The class Item inherits from GameObject, but it is not allowed to be on an Occupiable object.
